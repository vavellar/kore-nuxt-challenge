# Kore technical challenge

this repository is a technical challenge for Kore and is built in nuxt.js

## The folder structure is as follows:
- `components/` - Vue.js components used in the application.
- `pages/` - Nuxt.js pages that define the routes of the application.
- `assets/` - Static assets such as images, stylesheets, and fonts.
- `app/` The root Vue.js component.
- `store/` - pinia store files for state management.
- `server/` - API routes.
- `tests/` - Unit tests for the application.

### For this project, i just created a simple nuxt application that fetches data from a mocked api inside the server folder. Only the "1" and "2" ids are working, so if you try to fetch another id, you will get an error
